# Capstone Project: Energy Consumption Analytics for GreenPower Utilities

## Overview
This project aims to build an end-to-end data engineering and forecasting pipeline to help **GreenPower Utilities** analyze energy consumption patterns, forecast demand, and generate actionable insights using public energy and weather datasets.

## Features Implemented

### Week 2 â€“ Data Cleaning
- Removed outliers, imputed missing timestamps, and aligned time intervals.

### ðŸ”¹ Week 3 â€“ Data Ingestion Pipeline
- Automated scripts for ingesting weather and energy data into SQLite.

### ðŸ”¹ Week 4 â€“ Feature Engineering
- Created aggregated features like hourly/daily consumption, peak-to-average ratios, etc.

### ðŸ”¹ Week 5 â€“ Forecasting
- Built and evaluated time-series models like **ARIMA** to forecast energy demand.

### ðŸ”¹ Week 6 â€“ Finalization
- Visualization.
- Dashboards planned using Streamlit.

## Datasets Used
- Weather data (2007, Paris) â€“ `.csv` files in `raw_data/`
- Cleaned and transformed datasets â€“ `intermediate_files/`
- Public sources: [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/), [UCI Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)

## Technologies & Tools
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly
- SQLite 
- Collab
- Git, GitHub, VS Code
